# Image Processing
Some additional codes for image preprocessing or postprocessing.

### File Description
- `discardShortFixations.m` for filtering the original data and converting them to saliency maps.
- `heatMapAll.m` for drawing heatmaps on the dataset.
- `imgsizeChange.m` for resizing images to simplify the computational complexity on deep learning models.
- `optDiff.m` for comparing the difference of two similar images and strengthening it.
