## Visual Pattern Comparison
Codes for visual pattern comparison.

### Files Description
In each folder contains files with the same name.
- `BCEA.m` and `find_ellipse_area.m` are for BCEA calculation.
- `statistics_fixationPoint.m` is for fixation metric calculation.
- `comparison.m` contains code for visional pattern comparison.
- `candle_bar.m` is for correlation analysis of bar length and the number of fixations.
- `graph_model.m` is for graph modeling.
- `laplace.m` is used to calculate the Laplacian energy of the graph.
- `valid_fixationPoint.m` and `bar_color.m` are used to evaluate the proportion of valid fixations and fixations on red bars.
- `poly_fit.m` and `poly_fit_ma.m` are not used in the paper.  
- `rate_comparison.ipynb` and `train_data.ipynb` are for valid rate and red rate analysis, and training demo data analysis respectively.

### Attention
In comparison part, we used only 5 professionals instead of all the 10.
